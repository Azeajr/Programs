Give the next five pseudorandom numbers generated by the process described
on page 113, with a=12, b=5, and n=100, and 92 as the seed for cur.
next = (a*cur + b) % n;

next = (12 * 92 + 5) % 100 = 9;
next = (12 * 9 + 5) % 100 = 13;
next = (12 * 13 + 5) % 100 = 61;
next = (12 * 61 + 5) % 100 = 37;
next = (12 * 37 + 5) % 100 = 49;
