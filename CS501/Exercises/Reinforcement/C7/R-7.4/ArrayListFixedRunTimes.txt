Give a justification of the running times shown in Table 7.1 for the methods of an array list implemented with a (nonexpanding) array.
Method      Running Time
size()      O(1)
isEmpty()   O(1)
get(i)      O(1)
set(i, e)   O(1)
add(i, e)   O(n)
remove(i)   O(n)

Regardless of the size of the array list:
size() still returns the size variable's contents
isEmpty() still compares the size variable to zero
get(i) returns whatever is located at i
set(i,e) changes the value located at i to e
