Can you adapt your solution to the previous problem to make removeMin run in O(1) time for the UnsortedPriorityQueue class? Explain your answer.

No.  If we incorporate removeMin it will run removeMin at O(1) if it is the first time it is run.  After that findMin would need to used to find the new minimum.  This runs at O(n) after which removeMin will run at O(1) and then the cycle would repeat.
