Let H be a heap storing 15 entries using the array-based representation of a complete binary tree. What is the sequence of indices of the array that are visited in a preorder traversal of H? What about an inorder traversal of H? What about a postorder traversal of H?
 preorder(0,1,3,7,8,4,9,10,2,5,11,12,6,13,14)
postorder(7,8,3,9,10,4,1,11,12,5,13,14,6,2,0)
  inorder(7,3,8,1,9,4,10,0,11,5,12,2,13,6,14)
