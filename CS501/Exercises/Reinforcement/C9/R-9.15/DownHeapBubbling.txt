Explain why the description of down-heap bubbling does not consider the case in which position p has a right child but not a left child.
Since a heap has to first adhere to the Complete Binary Tree property, then insertions are guaranteed to fill a tree from left to right.  If a parent has a right child but no left child then that tree can not be considered a heap.
