An airport is developing a computer simulation of air-traffic control that handles events such as landings and takeoffs.  Each event has a time stamp that denotes the time when the event will occur.  The simulation program needs to efficiently perform the following two fundamental operations:
    Insert an event with a given time stamp (that is, add a future event).
    Extract the event with smallest time stamp (that is, determine the next event to process).
Which data structure should be used for the above operations? Why?

A priority queue seems like the perfect choice for this situation.  The time stamp would work as our key.  It would dictate exactly where in the queue the events would be added.
