Give an example of a worst-case sequence with n elements for insertion-sort, and show that insertion-sort runs in Ω(n²) time on such a sequence.
(9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)
(1,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2)     1 swap, 8 shifts    = 9 operations
(1,2,9,8,7,6,5,4,3)     1 swap, 7 shifts    = 8 operations
(1,2,3,9,8,7,6,5,4)     1 swap, 6 shifts    = 7 operations
(1,2,3,4,9,8,7,6,5)     1 swap, 5 shifts    = 6 operations
    ....                ....            ....
(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)     1 swap, 0 shifts    = 1 operation
∴ Ω(1+2+3+....+n) = Ω(n²)
