Suppose an initially empty stack S has performed a total of 25 push operations, 12 top operations, and 10 pop operations, 3 of which returned null to indicate an empty stack.  What is the current size of S?

The size of the stack will end up being 18.  The 12 top operations do not effect the size of the stack. Since 3 of the 10 pop operations had no effect(returned null) that means 7 of them did end up removing an element.  25 minus 7 equals 18.
