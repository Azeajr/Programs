The use of null values in a map is problematic, as there is then no way to
differentiate whether a null value returned by the call get(k) represents the
legitimate value of an entry (k,null), or designates that key k was not found.
The java.util.Map interface includes a boolean method, containsKey(k), that
resolves any such ambiguity. Implement such a method for the UnsortedTableMap
class.

 boolean containsKey(K key){
     return findIndex(key) != -1;
 }
