What is the worst-case running time for inserting n key-value pairs into an initially empty map M that is implemented with the UnsortedTableMap class?
Each fundamental method takes O(n) time in the worst case because of the need to scan through the entire list when searching for an existing entry.

Since I have to insert n ky-value pairs each insert will increase in complexity as the map size increases.
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + .... + (n-1) + n  = n(n+1)/2
Therefore the complexity will be O(nÂ²).
