Consider lines 31–33 of Code Fragment 10.8 in our implementation of the class
ChainHashMap. We use the difference in the size of a secondary bucket before and
after a call to bucket.remove(k) to update the variable n. If we replace those
three lines with the following, does the class behave properly? Explain.

     int oldSize = bucket.size();
     V answer = bucket.remove(k);
     n −= (oldSize − bucket.size());


    V answer = bucket.remove(k);
    if (answer != null){
        n−−;
    }
The class will not behave properly.  The new code assumes that each bucket only
contains one value(n--).  This is not a correct assumption as a bucket can
contain more that one value.  The code we actually used correctly removes
however many values were actually removed.
