What would be a good hash code for a vehicle identification number that is a
string of numbers and letters of the form “9X9XX99X9XX999999,”where a “9”
represents a digit and an “X” represents a letter?
A Polynomial hash code or Cyclic-Shift hash code would be a good hash code since there would need to be a
distinction between vin with the same character but different orders.
