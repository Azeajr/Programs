Draw the 11-entry hash table that results from using the hash function,
h(i) = (3i+5) mod 11, to hash the keys
12, 44, 13, 88, 23, 94, 11, 39, 20, 16, and 5,
assuming collisions are handled by chaining.
0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10
13  94              44          12  16  20
    39              88          23  5
                    11
