 An alternative way of performing a split at a node w in a (2,4) tree is to
 partition w into w′ and w′′, with w′ being a 2-node and w′′ a 3-node. Which of the
 keys k1, k2, k3, or k4 do we store at w’s parent? Why?
 If w' has 2 nodes then it should have k1, while w" having 3 nodes means that
 keys k3 and k4 belong with it.  This leaves k2 to be added to parent node of
 both w' and w".
