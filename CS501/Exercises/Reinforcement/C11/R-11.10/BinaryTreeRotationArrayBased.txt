Explain why performing a rotation in an n-node binary tree when using the array
based representation of Section 8.3.2 takes â„¦(n) time.

An imbalance in a tree that warrants a rotation will end up changing at least
the root node.  This ends up changing absolutely every singled node in an array
based implementation since the subsequent children of the new root have to be
placed in their new position in the array.
