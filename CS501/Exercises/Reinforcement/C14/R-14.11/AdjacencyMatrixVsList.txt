Would you use the adjacency matrix structure or the adjacency list structure in
each of the following cases? Justify your choice.
a. The graph has 10,000 vertices and 20,000 edges, and it is important to use as
little space as possible.
Adjaceny list is prefered since it's space usage is O(n+m) or in this case
30,000 vs O(n^2) with 100,000,000

b. The graph has 10,000 vertices and 20,000,000 edges, and it is important to
use as little space as possible.
Accoding to the general case the adjacency matrix has a space usage of O(n^2) or
100,000,000 vs O(n+m) with 20,010,000.  But this graph is actually considered
very dense.  At this point an adjacency list consumes the same space as as
adjacency matrix.  At that point a I would choose a adjacency matrix.

c. You need to answer the query getEdge(u, v) as fast as possible, no matter how
much space you use.
Adjaceny matrix completes00 this task in constant time O(1) vs O(m) of an adjacency list.
