Describe the meaning of the graphical conventions used in Figure 14.9
illustrating a DFS traversal. What do the line thicknesses signify? What do the
arrows signify? How about dashed lines?
Line thickness: Edges that were traversed and successfully found a new vertex.(Discovery Edges)
Direction of arrow: The direction in which the edge was traversed.
Dashed lines: Edges that were traversed but unsuccesfully found a new vertex.(Back edges)
