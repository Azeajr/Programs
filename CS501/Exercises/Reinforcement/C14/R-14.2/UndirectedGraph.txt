what is the largest number of edges it might have?
30 edges
1st component       2nd component       3rd component
8 vertices          2 vertices          2 vertices
28 edges            1 edge              1 edges

4 vertices          4 vertices          4 vertices
6 edges             6 edges             6 edges
