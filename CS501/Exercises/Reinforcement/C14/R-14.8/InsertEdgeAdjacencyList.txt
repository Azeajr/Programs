Repeat Exercise R-14.7 for the adjacency list representation, as described in
the chapter.

Algorithm:  insertEdge(u, v, x)
    Input:  Vertices u and v and element x.
    Output: An edge connecting vertices u and v while storing element x.

    Create edge(u,v)
    Add edge to u and v's incidence collections.
