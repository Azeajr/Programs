 *  Draw a simple, connected, directed graph with 8 vertices and 16 edges such
 *  that the in-degree and out-degree of each vertex is 2. Show that there is a
 *  single (nonsimple) cycle that includes all the edges of your graph, that is,
 *  you can trace all the edges in their respective directions without ever
 *  lifting your pencil. (Such a cycle is called an Euler tour.)
