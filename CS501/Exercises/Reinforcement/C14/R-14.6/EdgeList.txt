Suppose we represent a graph G having n vertices and m edges with the edge list
structure. Why, in this case, does the insertVertex method run in O(1) time
while the removeVertex method runs in O(m) time?

When the removeVertex method is called not only does the vertex need to be
removed but all incident edges.  To determine which edges are incident that
involves a search of each edge for incidence with the vertex to be removed.
