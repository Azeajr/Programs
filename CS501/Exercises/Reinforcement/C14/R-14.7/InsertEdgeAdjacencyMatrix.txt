Give pseudocode for performing the operation insertEdge(u, v, x) in O(1) time
using the adjacency matrix representation.

Algorithm:  insertEdge(u, v, x)
    Input:  Vertices u and v and element x.
    Output: An edge connecting vertices u and v while storing element x.
    Create edge(u,v)
    Store x in this edge.
    Set G[u][v] to point to this new edge;
