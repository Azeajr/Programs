Start by storing the first value of the array.
Store the last value in the array as the first value.
Store the temporary value at the end of the array.
If the array is even continue swapping until the halfway point is reached.
If the array is odd the middle value will not need to be swapped.

void reverseArray(int arr[]){
    int n= arr.length;
    /*
     * This ends up working out because when n is even, say n=6,
     * then n/2 will equal 3.  Due to zero indexing, this means
     * that that the first three elements will be swapped with
     * the last three.  If n is odd, say n=5, then n/2 will
     * equal 2.  Once again, zero indexing makes this only
     * effect the first two elements swapping with the last two.
     * The middle element does not need to be swapped.
     */
    for(int i = 0; i < n/2; i++){

    }
}
