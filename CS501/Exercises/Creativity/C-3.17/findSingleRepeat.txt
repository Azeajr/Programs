Let A be an array of size n>=2 containing integers from 1 to n-1 inclusive, one of which is repeated. Describe an algorithm for finding the integer in A that is repeated.

int[] A = new int[10];

for(int i = 0; i < A.length; i++){
    for(int j = i+1; j < A.length; j++){
        if(A[i]==A[j]){
            return A[i];
        }
    }
}
