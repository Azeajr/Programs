Let B be an array of size n>=6 containing integers from 1 to n-5 inclusive, five of which are repeated. Describe an algorithm for finding the five integers in B that are repeated.

int[] B = new int[10];
count = 0;

for(int i = 0; i < B.length; i++){
    for(int j = i+1; j < B.length; j++){
        if(B[i]==B[j]){
            count++;
        }
        if(count==5){
        return B[j];
        }
    }
}
