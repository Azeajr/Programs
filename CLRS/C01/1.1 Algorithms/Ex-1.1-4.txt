How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?

The shortest-path and the traveling-salesman problems are similar because:
* in each we are trying to determine the paths between vertices.

The shortest-path and the traveling-salesman problems are different because:
* in shortest-path all we care about is that the path is shortest, while in traveling-salesman we need that path to be a cycle.
* in the shortest-path we do not have to visit every node to achieve a shortest path, while in traveling-salesman every node must be visited.
