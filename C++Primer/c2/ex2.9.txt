Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal, explain whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it.
(a) std::cin >> int input_value;

(b) int i = { 3.14 };
Error, narrowing conversion required

(c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;
I believe this only works if wage was previously instantiated.
One correction could be, double salary, wage = salary = 9999.99


(d) int i = 3.14;
This compiles and runs fine but data is lost due to truncation.
