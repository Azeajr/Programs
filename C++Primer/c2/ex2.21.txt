Explain each of the following definitions. Indicate whether any are illegal and, if so, why.
int i = 0;

(a) double* dp = &i;
Illegal, because it is assigning the address of an int to a pointer of type double.
(b) int *ip = i;
Legal, but it might not be what the user intended.  The pointer has been given the address 0x00000000 which amounts to a null pointer.  The user most likely wanted ip to point to the address of i, &i.
(c) int *p = &i;
Legal and logical.
