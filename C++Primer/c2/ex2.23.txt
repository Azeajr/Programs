Given a pointer p, can you determine whether p points to a valid object? If so, how? If not, why not?

In general, it is not possible to determine if a pointer is valid or not. If the you have implemented your pointers such that they point to NULL if they are invalid then this can serve as method for determining if a pointer is valid.
